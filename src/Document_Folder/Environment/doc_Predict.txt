8 years ago Predictions for sea level rise by 2100? Sea level rise is one of the main threats of a warming world (i.e. due to melting land ice and ocean thermal expansion).
The IPCC has some modest predictions of 18 to 59 cm by 2100.
There are many experts who are not happy with that low a prediction and claim one meter or more is possible. The current rate of sea level rise has been fairly accurate since the launch of altimeter satellites beginning in 1993.
The group that operates these satellites have the current annual sea level as rising at a rate of 3.1mm/year.
Doing some fairly rough math, that has sea levels being about 27cm up in 2100 (assuming no rate change) which is on the very low end of predictions. So your first thought might be, let's look at sea level rate changes.
I have dug up three every recent studies all of which show a deceleration of sea level rates. http://www.co2science.org/articles/V15/N31/C1.php http://www.jcronline.org/doi/pdf/10.2112/JCOASTRES... http://www.jcronline.org/doi/abs/10.2112/JCOASTRES... In order to hit one meter of sea level rise by 2100, the average yearly rise will have to be about 11mm/ year.
I cannot see this occurring or even being close to occurring.
I don't believe there has been any year in the past say 150 that has come close to that figure.
And it appears the rate of rise is currently decreasing on top of that. So how can some sea level expert support a figure of one meter (or more) of sea level rise by 2100? Update : _______________________________________________________- @Hey Dook:
"Science does not depend on predictions." I don't think I've encountered a more unscientific statement here or anywhere else. "Scientific hypothesis and prediction Established science makes useful predictions which are extremely reliable and accurate; for example, eclipses are routinely predicted.
New theories make predictions which allow them to be falsified if the predictions are not borne out in reality." Everybody knows that, except you apparently. Update 2 : Stephen Hawking states, "A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations." Etc. Update 3 : ______________________________________________________ @******:
I'm not quite following exactly what your answer is.
From your sources, you appear to quote the opinion of an astronomer and noted AGW alarmists Rahmstorf and Foster (those sea level experts I was asking about) supporting their study that is predicting one meter or more by 2100.
Rahmstorf's work in particular has been eviscerated many times over.
http://www.burtonsys.com/climate/rahmstorf/ In scientific terms, I would say your answer is not robust enough and thus without additional details cannot qualify for best answer. Answer Save 12 Answers Relevance antarcticice Lv
7 8 years ago Favorite Answer Have to say Ottawa you do make it easy to show up your nonsense "@******: I'm not quite following exactly what your answer is. From your sources, you appear to quote the opinion of an astronomer and noted AGW alarmists Rahmstorf and Foster" a) Rahmstorf is actually referenced (twice) in the paper you linked to from Co2science, did you read the citations b) "astronomer" interesting as the Stefan Rahmstorf I know of actually has Ph.D. in oceanography, do check your facts before making a fool of yourself. http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~stefan/cv.html c) "Rahmstorf's work in particular has been eviscerated many times over" by who, certainly nothing in genuine journals, but then your link doesn't go to any published journal does it, it's just another personal blog referencing yet more unsubstantiated BS by people like Steve McIntyre, now if you really want to talk about someone who's work has actually been eviscerated, try him. ******'s answer to you is pretty straight forward, that this would scare you is understandable, that you claim you can't understand it also pretty understandable, as that would entail trying to address his points and pretty clearly that is beyond you. The sources you quote like McIntyre are the same ones, who based on a lull in sea level rise due to a cooler 2011 claimed "sea level rise was over" a set of claims I think you can still find on WUWT. The same WUWT who has steadfastly ignored what sea levels actually did soon after these claims from McIntyre, but then McIntyres claims like many denier claims are throw away one liners, when they are overtaken by the facts you simply move on to the next one and pretend the claim was never made. Sea level did not listen to McIntyre and the claimed end simply did not happen in fact sea level rise is back to near the average rise rate. http://sealevel.colorado.edu/ You talk of 11mm a year and suggest that can't happen and even make vague allusions to the rate slowing, yet even a basic understand of how ice melts should tell you how this could or will happen. A simple experiment for you, as you seem to demonstrate no understanding of the processes, Defrost the freezer box of a fridge (refrigerator) by simply opening the the door, at first nothing will happen then a slow drip of water (about were we are in the larger scale) once you have liquid flowing the process speeds up and the ice melts faster, but still takes a while much of the bulk of the ice actually melts fairly quickly in the last part of the experiment as the ice loses mass and water states to flow more freely. You can quite simply increase the speed of this by introducing water poured onto the ice to speed up the melting, in much the same way that rain in a warmer world will affect glaciers. Scale up your freezer to the size of Antarctic and the processes take decades and centuries to happen, but all the signs of them starting to happen are there, increased iceberg carving, increased flow rates on glaciers in Alaska, Greenland and Antarctica.
"In scientific terms" sadly you continue to demonstrate you don't know what the phase even means. 0 5 0 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 8 years ago I believe that the IPCC projections for sea levels are based on thermo expansion alone and do not include the effects of melting glaciers. And, given that their projections are modest, does it really sound like they are trying to scare people, as denialists claim. <In order to hit one meter of sea level rise by 2100, the average yearly rise will have to be about 11mm/ year.
I cannot see this occurring or even being close to occurring.> Why? Do you trust climate models that much? I you do, you trust them more than I do. <Stephen Hawking states, "A theory is a good theory if it satisfies two requirements: It must accurately describe a large class of observations on the basis of a model that contains only a few arbitrary elements, and it must make definite predictions about the results of future observations."> Did Professor Hawking ever claim that AGW fails either of those requirements? Actually, a climate model which does not include solar activity, aerosols and man made greenhouse gases does fail the first. The main problem with the idea that current global warming is natural is that no known natural forcing has shown a trend that could explain this current global warming. Solar activity has shown a downward trend over the last fifty years and Earth's orbital variations have been in a very slow cooling trend for the last 6,000 years. http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-c... http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/ccr/ottobli/pubs/Otto-Blie...
I admit that the second criterion could be troublesome, because we don't know how to predict solar and volcanic activity. That does not mean that AGW is not a threat. 0 11 2 Login to reply the answers Post Gas By Fannylight Lv
7 8 years ago I've seen this explained here a few times before, you must have missed those questions mike. The ocean buffers temperature through thermal mixing. This is a dynamic process with obvious thresholds depending on the amount of warming and the direction the mixing takes (ie increased deep water mxing or increased stratification).
https://www.e-education.psu.edu/drupal6/files/geog... So looking at this graph, you can see all the increases are curved and not straight line increases. The lower threshold is the most straight, relating to direct changes in air temp. The higher values are more curved, since they depend on the enhanced effects of the additional variants being the degree of mixing. If you take the current data on thermal mixing, simulate changes in temperature, run 100K simulations and plot the result, it will give you an idea as to which direction the mixing will take. Add to this the potential effects on ocean currents etc and you get a wider range of potential outcomes. It really is that simple!
When you consider the fact that GHG emissions are continuing to increase, it would be unrealistic to assume that the rate of sea level increase will remain at 3.1mm/year. How much it changes depends on how much GHGs increase and what happens next in the ocean as a result of increasing sea surface temperatures. Source(s):

7 8 years ago The higher figures are based on the accelerating rate of melting of the Greenland ice cap.
The 3.1 mm per year comes only from thermal expansion; melting of land ice is not figured into that at all but may become the primary cause of sea level rise relatively soon. http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2011/2011GL046583... 0 9 2 Login to reply the answers Post How do you think about the answers?

6 8 years ago I think the assumption of no change in rate is why you are lower than the predictions.
AGW is suppose to increase during that time period and heat is a cumulative thing, so is you need to assume a rate of increase proportional to the expected heating, your estimates will change.
The best way to approach the problem is using scenario.
Define a "low AGW" scenario and a "high AGW" scenario as well as a "most likely AGW scenario.
Test to see how sensitive you results are to the assumptions in the scenario, and that will point you to where your need to expend the most effort to be sure you scenarios are realistic for what they represent. 0 7 3 Login to reply the answers Post Gringo Lv
6 8 years ago Your whole 'question' basically boils down to this: <<So how can some sea level expert support a figure of one meter (or more) of sea level rise by 2100?>> Which you then counter with 3 peer-reviewed papers (one by an automotive engineer) which claim they have not spotted any accelerated sea level increase. You, and all the other non-experts like the folks over at WUWT who, surprise surprise, covered the same non-paper by former FIAT/Chrysler engineer Alberto Boretti, ignore the whole well-understood physics aspect whereby water takes a bit of time to warm up and childishly assume that in order to reach a 1 meter sea level increase by 2100 there simply has to be some 10mm per year. That's pathetic. The title of Boretti's paper is telling ("Short term comparison of climate model predictions and satellite altimeter measurements of sea levels") yet somehow ignored. And in his 2012 paper Boretti looks at IPCC predictions made 5 years ago and Rahmstorf predictions made 2 years ago for the total sea level rise by the year 2100 and amazingly is able to conclude 'it's not happening' after 5 and 2 years, respectively. That's like saying Usain Bolt is not going to win the 1,000 m because after just a 100 meters he's still in 3rd place! The same can be said about Houston and Dean's paper which concluded that sea level rise had not accelerated; it is nice to know but it says absolutely nothing about sea level rise by the year 2100. Watson paper, " Is There Evidence Yet of Acceleration in Mean Sea Level Rise around Mainland Australia?", is more of the same as any real skeptic would have understood from the title alone. But denier blogs are all over it, they love it and many of the commenters there (and even deniers here) appear to believe that sea levels have not risen at all. Wishfull thinking; just as the notion that no ACCELERATED rise now means none will have happened by the year 2100. Edit @ OM: << I'm not quite following exactly what your answer is.>> The predictions for total sea level rise are for the year 2100. The IPCC conservative estimate is from 2007 and Rahmstorf's latest study is from 2010 while all your 3 studies are from this year. That means that 5 and respectively 2 years have passed since the original 2100 predictions which your 3 papers try to undermine with still 88 years to go until 2100. It is no surprise really for any real skeptic that none of the 3 papers you cite have noticed any ACCELERATED sea level increase in such a short period of time.
<< From your sources, you appear to quote the opinion of an astronomer and noted AGW alarmists Rahmstorf and Foster (those sea level experts I was asking about)... >> Stefan Rahmstorf is one of the world's leading oceanographers and climatologists with multiple peer reviewed science papers (not to be confused with opinion pieces posted on blogs!) published on the subject while mathematician Tamino (Grant Foster) specializes in the statistical aspects of many claims by deniers.
<<Rahmstorf's work in particular has been eviscerated many times over.>> And than you link to a webpage run by a photovoltaic expert which lists: - a Spiegel article; - 2 blogposts by a mechanical engineer (Lucia Liljegren) - 1 blogpost by mathematician and mining consultant Steve McIntyre - 1 non-peer reviewed opinion piece written by a real estate investor and board member of a lobby group which opposes restrictions on coastal development (John Droz) - several blogposts (Tom Moriarty lets us Google it ourselves) by a Ph.D. in Ecosystem Dynamics who frequently publishes at Energy & Environment and who has zero expertise (and research papers published) on sea levels increase. Ergo, your claim 'Rahmstorf's work in particular has been eviscerated many times over' is not supported by any real science, the one you always claim to be so interested in. <<In scientific terms, I would say your answer is not robust enough and thus without additional details cannot qualify for best answer.>> Sea level predictions are based on physics, not just observed sea level increases over the past few years which forms the basis of the 3 papers you referred to. Your 'science' is equivalent to putting a pan of cold water on a fire, sticking your hand in after 60 seconds to find it has hardly warmed at all and thus concluding it will not warm in 10 minutes time either. That's wholly non-scientific as it ignores well-known physics. Source(s):

4 8 years ago As long as you're a "scientist" who works for the UN, anything you say in favour of their agenda is true. Anyone who dares to disagree are heretics and should be ignored.
That's basically what the media want you to think. Remember, many UN officials predicted the end of the world by the year 2000 because of this "global warming", did it happen? No. But of course, the media made sure everyone forgot those alarmist predictions and this time, the predictions have been made when we probably won't be around any longer to witness if they come true or not.
IF, and I say IF, If the sea levels rise, it will be because of global warming, not anthropogenic global warming, therefore technology should be going into adaptation rather than "prevention" which is just nonsense as you can't prevent a natural and unstoppable event. 0 3 8 Login to reply the answers Post john m Lv
4 8 years ago Hi Mike Do you know were their made calculations on sea level rise due to erosion of land mass Like how many cubic metres of silt go into the oceans from our river systems and coastal erosion and then of cause how many cubic metres of waste do we throw into the oceans Things like this has to add to see level rise over time
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_waste_dumping_b...
. How many plains, ships, tanks, vehicles and equipment
lay on the sea floor The melting of ice that is on land will only increase ocean level slightly. Water expands when it freezes and shrinks when it thaws .cheers 0 0 5 Login to reply the answers Post JimZ Lv
7 8 years ago Their predictions never seem to rely on real world data.
Their predictions rely on the need to scare people and for that they need to pull highly massaged models and fudged calculations out of their (*** ahh scratch that word) hat.
27 cm isn't scary enough for people to give the government more of their hard earned money.
They need to really scare to push their political agenda so using realistic figures probably wouldn't be sufficient.
Since it is a somewhat cyclical graph (or would be if it extended long enough back into the past), I don't think any predictions of where the sea level will be in a hundred years is reliable.
Predicting that it will suddenly start accelerating is laughable, if not predictable. 0 5 10 Login to reply the answers Post Anonymous 8 years ago It
